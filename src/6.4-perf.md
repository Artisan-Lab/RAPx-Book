# Chapter 6.4. Performance Bug Detection
This module is designed to identify performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies within a program by employing static analysis methods. After the analysis, rap will report potential code inefficiencies and their positions.

**This module is still under development.**

## Performance Bugs Supported

### Bounds checking
An example of unnecessary bounds checking is as follows.
```rust
fn foo(mut a: Vec<i32>) {
    for i in 0..a.len() {
        a[i] = a[i] + 1;
    }
}
```
Here RAPx will suggest replacing the safe `index` API with unsafe APIs.

### Memory cloning
RAPx will report a warning where a cloned object is used as a immutable value. **Developers need to manually check whether to remove the cloning or not.**

An example is as follows. Here the cloning is unnecessary because we can use borrowings as keys of the `HashSet`.

```rust
fn foo(a: &Vec<String>) {
    let mut b = HashSet::new();
    for i in a {
        let c = i.clone();
        b.insert(c);
    }
}
```

### Data collections

Sometimes there exists a better data collection with higher performance. RAPx will detect the pattern and give suggestions.

An example where `HashSet` is better than `Vec` is shown as follows.
```rust
fn foo(a: Vec<i32>, b: Vec<i32>) {
    for i in b.iter() {
        if a.contains(i) {}
    }
}
```

## Usage
To detect such bugs, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command.
```shell
cargo rapx -opt
```
